    <td>The lesson started with our teacher saying that we were no longer doing codecademy in lessons, and that we would moving onto a different coding platform (repl.it) which used Python3. So we created our repl.it accounts and started to work our way through a worksheet that used Python3 to make a sort of conversation with you and the computer. We coded it to ask us our name, and once we'd put our names into the program, it then said "hello ___. As we went through the exercises that were gradually building this conversation to ask our surname, then calculate our initials, and say our name back to front and with capitals or no capitals.

    <td>I will focus only on my work and aim to progress further into the Python course on a whole, now that we are on repl.it. I will resist the urge to hinder my learning by unnecessarily 'helpingâ€™ others. </td>
